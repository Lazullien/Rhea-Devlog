# Rhea-Devlog
The devlog for depositing demo versions and stuff about rhea, for further detail check the one in projects

A sandbox-platformer game where resources are also limited and you'll need to cherish the environment to collect resources to survive and beat the game

I'm planning on the final version to include psychological horror elements and fourth wall breaking but for now I'll be focusing mainly on art and gameplay
