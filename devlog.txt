//devlog for Rhea, copy to project

*The entire devlog of Rhea from the birth of the name to date, it may appear as completely different games at different periods, this is true,
*now I've gone and collapsed all possibilities into the current form, the sandbox platformer, this update was done around December 2022, if
*you wanna keep do date start from there, the rest just exists to embarrass me, you can really see my development alongside the game this way too!.

iteration system for chunks complete, although bugs appear to not paint the world (resolved)

9/4/2022
temperature calculation done

9/11/2022 note: get media guys (gamers) to promote game, not just a sponser, a gameplay video
                  budget: 1500 bucks

                  basic collision done

jump not working properly, so is falling

3 months in, wow

plans tomorrow to add proper 3d top down rendering

10/1/2022
cursor basic actions done

10/2/2022
wavefunctioncollapse generation somewhat done

10/5/2022
entropy coordinate superposition wave somehow gets turned into size 0

10/7/2022
basic 2d wave function collapse without weight implementation completed

10/15/2022
hotbar done, thinking of doing a mass based world viewing system

10/16/2022
new idea, achievement evaluation system where the one watching asks you questions and talks with you
"what was it for" "good job" "i love this world you've shaped" "why are you so passionate"
"why can't i be like you"
Game experience: feeling fantastic about building your own haven
overall goal: build a virtual world to your liking

10/17/2022
new shadow movement system, human into pointershadow into human into editorshadow into human and activate edits
tomorrow set viewing in shadow for cursors and selection stopping cursor attraction system

10/23/2022
it seems the chunks are being unloaded when in shadow camera, gonna do a check with loadedchunks.size()
cover basic function is completed (the one with WFC). Just need to find the problem with keyhandler finalselect in different methods
certain dialogues for dream cutscenes are completed, these will take time in multiplayer, but pauses time in singleplayer.

10/27/2022
basic 3d rendering done

11/19/2022
change of game: build a sanctuary in an antarctic hostile environment
tomorrow start with breathing system
add tamable native creatures

11/23/2022
ending you get to leave the place and enter freeplay area, but you could always come back to this "reality" (maybe remove)
add flashlight effect, the surrounding darkens and transforms into weird unsettling colors

11/23/2022
death punishment shall be losing your shit
basically to survive you'll have to explore and build an ecosystem

12/2/2022 reindeers

12/4/2022 reminder that the game is about taking risks and stuff in an extremely resource limited situation 
also fighting and killing is a last resort and heavily disencouraged, the goal is for you to overcome difficulties, not
for you to go megalomaniac

12/7/2022
fishing is also a source of food, raw tho
foraging also can provide food, but it's rare to find them around, and most of them are poisonous, but plants are plantable
hunting is allowed, but dangerous since animals who could survive here most likely aren't weak themselves
present mind polluting entities who disencourages you, later on you get strong enough to simply kill them
turning de-motivation into motivation

12/12/2022
have different weather represent different states of mind
all of these could be survived with enough skill and luck and could even be taken advantage of
blizzard - loneliness - build casting
tornado - anxious - demolition or exploration
hail - hopeless - weaponize (kinda hard to use this one for anything else)
volcano - anger - heat supply (yes there are lots of volcanoes in antarctica, these mostly appear around geothermal oasises)


//THIS IS THE COLLAPSED FORM OF THIS GAME
12/26/2022
system of defense, basically your goal is to defend yourself against natural disasters, this is based on a rock paper scissors like system
mostly using temperature, precipitation and resistance of tiles

1/13/2023
platformer sandbox instead
use spike generation and add material restrictions to tiles

1/15/2023
done with a prototype of building
tomorrow perfect jumping

1/18/2023
add spikes to either cave walls, or use another layer of 2d perlin noise for less linear spikes
try interpolating border values first, else 

1/21/2023
added umbrella movements as glide and umbrella jump, as well as further hitbox and momentum perfection

1/18/2023
changing the movement code into a vector based format for precise actions and easier editing
