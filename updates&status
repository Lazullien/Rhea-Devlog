i'm working on the first prototype of the game

i do have a drawing version of it on my twitter, you can get there by checking my profile

the game is estimated to be released around either late 2024 or early 2025, and may receive setbacks due to the developer(me) being under asian education
i'll stay updated so you won't get an omori like situation

since winter break is over i will now have shorter time to develop the game, however i have thought about an optimal method
of making a good platformer in sandbox that is to have a ray trajectory while placing tiles, this could be very much
used for deeper methods of playing around with the movement type tiles the game has to offer (blast, climb, etc.)
i'm not sure whether to keep the preset system in however, it pains me to say this but it might be deprecated

I'll be working on the ray placement for now
